## Offline NEM Transaction Signer

Using this app, one can safely and securely generate a transaction (invoice et al) and sign it to generate a QR. The QR will then be scanned using the companion [transaction broadcast app](https://github.com/Antownee/nem-transaction-broadcaster-ionic) whose job is solely to broadcast the transaction on to the NEM network.
This then provides a complete offline and airgapped solution.
